# IntroAstroSim
Simulations for Introductory Astronomy Labs

Currently includes:
- Moons of Jupiter Simulation: plots the relative positions of Jupiter's Galilean moons that can be used to measure Jupiter's mass.
- HR Diagram: includes real and simulated photometric data for students to build their own HR Diagram.
- stardata.xlsx: Data for the HR Diagram simulation.  The file is set up to allow users to easily add their own datasets.
- Spectral Classification: plots spectra of stars with known and unknown spectral types, as well as some common absorption line lables, for spectral classification.
- Spectroscopic Binary Simulator: plots the radial velocity curve as well as visualized orbit of a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2).  Option to include data from real SB2 systems using the included data file.
- SB2 data.xlsx: Data for the Spectroscopic Binary Simulator.  The file is set up to allow users to easily add their own datasets.
- Rotation of the Sun: plots images of the Sun from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory that can be used to measure the Sun's rotation period.
- Galaxy Rotation Curves: plots the co-added rotation curves from Dehghani et al. (2020, A&A, 643, A161) for users to measure the approximate dark matter and stellar masses of several galaxies.
- dehghani+2020.tsv: Data from Dehghani et al. (2020, A&A, 643, A161) to be used with the Galaxy Rotation Curves tool.
